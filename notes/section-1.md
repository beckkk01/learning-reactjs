    - Maintained by Meta

Components, JSX & State

    - Building User Interfaces With Components
    - Using, Sharing & Outputting Data
    - Handling User Events
    - Building Interactive UIs with State

Components are UIs Building Blocks. React Apps are built by combining components.

JSX stands for JavaScript Syntax Extension
    - Used to describe & create HTML elements in JavaScript in a Declarative way.
    - It is not supported by browsers
    - React Projects come with a build process that transforms JSX code (behind the scenes) to code that does work in browsers.

## Component Functions Must Follow These Rules

    - The Function name must start with an uppercase character
    - Muilt-word names should be writen in PascalCase (eg. 'MyHeader')
    - Recommended to pick a name that describes the UI Building block
    - Returns 'Renderable Content', in most cases JSX
